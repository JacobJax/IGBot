# IGBot🕹
An Instagram Likes❤ Bot🕹.
It automatically logs into Insta, searches for your prefered _Hashtag_, likes the most recent posts so as to get you Followers🎊 - _PROBABLY_


> _**NOTE**_
> 
> IGBot does **NOT** gurantee you followers and may therefore cause dissapointment. The essence of the Bot is purely educational


## Languages and Technologies 🏗
* Python
* Selenium


## How it works
IGBot consists of two parts, **a console app** and the **web automation**. 
When you run the program, it will prompt you for a _username_ and _password_ (your instagram login details).
You'll then be prompted for your prefered hashtag and then press *ENTER* and let it do its thing


## Comments
The code can still be iproved; the Error Handling especially. Feel free however to fork the project and use it to build something cool
